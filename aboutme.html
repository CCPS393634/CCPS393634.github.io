  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>In my personal life I am working on having good working skills a thing that most people in my generation lack and in my professional life I am working toward becoming a real estate agent. My personal experience have led me to these conclusions during the summer I started to notice how much everyone wants a home in Florida and not just that I'm good talking to people and have good customer service skills.

As of now I am working towards my goals daily I already have a basic understanding of how the work industry operates due to me working part time at Publix. I also work towards my goal daily because I am a volunteer and i know how to make customers feel good.

As a value I view as most important for success I think it is loyalty and resilience loyalty without it most people would not hold down a job or customers would stop buying products because they feel that they are not being given the respect they deserve. With resilience you have to be able to go through the tough times and not crumple or fold under the pressure and be able to do things in hard situation's that seem like they have no easy way out of them.

In the future I also have some short term goals for one I have the short term goal of moving out of my parents home when I turn 18 and showing that I am a responsible respectable adult another short term goal. That I had in my mind was having the chance to play for a sports team or do some extracellular or maybe help clean up somewhere or community service.

All in all the character traits and way I want to be known is a person who was not like the rest someone who made a difference somebody that thought outside the box. And most important I want to be a responsible respectable person in society known for have done great things.     </p>
